## Task Overview

This project is a **Next.js landing page** built to exactly match a custom Figma design provided by **Ena Ema Technologies**.  

**Objectives:**  
- Convert the design into a fully responsive web page  
- Ensure high-quality, reusable, and maintainable code  
- Implement smooth animations and modern UI components  

**Special Notes:**  
- Animations are implemented using **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**, not `motion.div`, which ensures excellent performance for a **static landing page**  
- The project is fully **CMS-ready-content**: content can easily be added or updated via the `content` folder using **YAML files**  
- Optimized for performance and scalability  
- **Minor spacing differences** (margins) may appear compared to Figma, since Figma sometimes does not display exact spacing; these are intentional and adjusted for **responsiveness and better UX**

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15** – React framework for production-grade apps

- **AOS** – Lightweight scroll animations for high performance  
- **LANIS** – Smooth scrolling
